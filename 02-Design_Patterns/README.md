# Design Patterns

**Design Patterns** are the standard solutions for commonly occuring problems in software designing.

**REAL LIFE SCENARIO:** Lets assume a company is designing a software in which 10 developers are working simaltaneously upon a similar software problem with different approaches. Let's say if every approach has their pros and cons with each other so in this case we can't decide which solution we need to go for. In this case, we will refer to design patterns which would be standard and most optimal way to avoid commonly occuring problem to design a software.

There are three types of design patterns:

1. **Creational Design Pattern:** This design pattern handles the solution for creation of objects. Eg: Singleton Design Pattern, Factory Design Pattern, Builder Design Pattern etc.

2. **Structural Design Pattern:** This design pattern handles the solution for designing the structure of a program. Eg: Proxy Design Pattern, Adaptor Design Pattern etc.

3. **Behavioral Design Pattern:** This design pattern handles the interaction among objects by mantaining their loosly coupled behavior. Eg: Observer Design Patter, State Design Pattern, Iterator Design Pattern etc.
