# Interpreter Design Pattern

Interpreter Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern in which we interpret or evaluate an expression or language grammer.

### Advantages
1. This design pattern is effective to create **interpreter** for **Domain Specific Languages (DSL)** where grammer rules are well defined and well structured.
2. It loosly coupled the **grammar (Context Class)** and **interpreter (Expression class)** logic which makes system easier to manage.
3. This design pattern makes easy to add new grammar rules in Context class and extend functionality in Expression.
4. This design pattern can evaluate complex expressions easily and effeciently.
